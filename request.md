# Request for Reputation

Dear Genesis DAO Reputation Holders, 

My name is Adam Grodowski (https://www.linkedin.com/in/agrodowski) and I would like to join your community to learn and experience the DAO concept put into practice. 
I am an IT entrepreneur (MSc in Software Engineering), specialised mainly in backend solutions (Java, C++, C, SQL) for the patent industry with some experience in the telecommunication field, but I am no stranger to blockchain nor crypto-currencies in general. Currently studying Solidity and taking first steps in writing (and reviewing) smart contracts and thinking how to apply it within my enterprise. Variety of IT related interests: cryptography, neural networks, algorithmics, the code quality. 

When I do not use the computer, I most likely hike, bike or read a book. ;-)

Looking forward to joining you!
Adam

PS. My current PGP key (a new one, sadly without WoT) 0x1164D0E5BBE8EEDA was used to sign the commit of that document to my newly created git 'daos' repository and you are welcome to verify.
