Hello! A newbie here (pending reputation proposal, you are welcome to upvote ;-) . I just wanted to say that I understand the need for accountability here to prevent spamming, took me a while to go through fakes yesterday as I was learning what the proposal is and how is functions here.

For all those that need verification to feel more secure within DAO, I propose to use the old PGP key signing face to face at any meetup opportunities and the web of trust will slowly grow within the DAO, first in obviously local sub-groups and later on, more globally when we have a chance for a global event of some sort. There is no point in outsourcing KYC from ourselves if we can just cross-verify ourselves in person whenever we have a chance.

For all those that require the full accountability for everything being said, you may find the exact copy of this message until the keyword END inclusive on my git signed with my key.
END
