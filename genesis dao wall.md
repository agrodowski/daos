Newbie here (awaiting rep proposal). Already commented on this <a href="http://disq.us/p/258a6or">here</a>, but as a short summary: we could have slowly build the trust within DAO by undergoing key signing and KYC in person. As we all travel and have opportunities to meet DAO members outside of our main location, the web of trust will expand if we always remember to verify your fellow DAO members whenever you have a chance. This, plus the git signed commits of all important messages as a proof of accountability for those people that require it. Once established, you can decide if you want to support and/or cooperate with 'trusted' members or not. There is no need to enforce anything, if you can choose. The copy of this message until the keyword END inclusive is signed as a git commit. END
